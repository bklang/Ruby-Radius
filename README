This is basically a fork of the rubyforge ruby-radius project at http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-radius/

I am working to make this library more easily used for radius daemons, and specifically for telecom cdr accounting. 

The radiusd.rb requires the eventmachine gem, and is a simple implementation of a radius server the just echo's avp's as they come in.

I have gutted all the stuff that I dont need in order to maintain clarity.  Basically this project can load up multiple standard format dictionaries, recieve and decode radius records.
