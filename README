This is basically a fork of the rubyforge ruby-radius project at http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-radius/

I am working to make this library more easily used for radius daemons, and specifically for telecom cdr accounting.  The primary difference will be modification to read a dictionary from a database rather than flat file.

The radiusd.rb requires the eventmachine gem, and is a simple implementation of a radius server the just echo's avp's as they come in.

To make db usage transparent, I have put in the framework for using active record outside of rails.  There is a Rakefile included that can be used for managing db migrations.

Database Usage
-----
To create a new database migration run:

rake db:new_migration name=FooBarMigration
edit migrations/20081220234130_foo_bar_migration.rb

To apply your newest migration

rake db:migrate

To migrate to a specific version (for example to rollback)

rake db:migrate VERSION=20081220234130

To migrate a specific database (for example your "testing" database)

rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
