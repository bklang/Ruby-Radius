This is a hack and slash rework of Rafael R. Sevilla's ruby-radius project.

I am basically turning this into a Radius Accounting Server that will allow storage of dictionaries and user's shared secrets in a database.

Right now radiusd.rb can decode Accounting Request packets using flat file dictionaries, and it generates and sends Accounting Response packets.

radiusd.rb requires the eventmachine gem, and is a simple implementation of a radius server the just echo's avp's as they come in.

I have gutted all the stuff that I dont need in order to maintain clarity.  There may be code that is silly, or unused right now - I will try to clean that up after I get the baseline more developed.
